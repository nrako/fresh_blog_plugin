# Fresh Blog Plugin

**A [üçã Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev) plugin designed to add blog
functionalities with markdown files powered by [MyST](https://mystmd.org)**.

## Features

- **[MyST](https://mystmd.org) Markdown syntax**: Offers an extended and richer
  Markdown syntax that caters not only to technical and scientific writing but
  also perfectly suits any kind of authoring and blogging. Naturally, it fully
  supports the standard Markdown, also known as
  [CommonMark](https://mystmd.org/guide/commonmark).
- **Code & Math**: Features code syntax highlighting and Tex Math rendering
  support out of the box, thanks to [Shiki](https://shiki.style) and
  [Katex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-katex).
- **Automatic Feed Syndication**: Seamlessly generates feeds for JSON Feed 1.0,
  Atom 1.0 and RSS 2.0. Ensures your content is readily consumable through any
  feed syndicate readers.
- **Modular Design**: Minimal, re-usable, ESM, functional components. If the
  default TailwindCSS component doesn't suit your taste, you have the freedom to
  craft your routes with your custom components. You can still leverage the data
  and processed HTML content from each markdown file.

## How It Works

This plugin exposes multiple configurable routes:

- Blog Index Route (default `/blog`): listing all posts sorted by their `date`
- Blog Post Route (default `/blog/:slug`): showing the detail of a post
  identified by the `:slug` which is inferred from the markdown file name
- Atom 1.0 Feed Route (default `/blog/atom`)
- JSON Feed 1.0 Feed Route (default `/blog/json`)
- RSS 2.0 Feed Route (default `/blog/rss`)

This plugin doesn't assume any assumption about your layout (i.e
`routes/_app.tsx`).

For customization of the default routes, please refer to the
"[Options](https://github.com/nrako/fresh_blog_plugin?tab=readme-ov-file#options)"
section below.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To incorporate the Fresh Blog Plugin into your Fresh website, update your
fresh.config.ts file as follows:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from '$fresh/server.ts'
import tailwind from '$fresh/plugins/tailwind.ts'
import blogPlugin from 'https://deno.land/x/fresh_blog_plugin/mod.ts'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [tailwind(), blogPlugin()],
})
```

**Note**: The use of TailwindCSS plugin `tailwind()` is optional. You are free
to omit `tailwind()` if you choose to use your own components.

### TailwindCSS Configuration

When opting for the default route handlers, components and TailwindCSS setup,
ensure your `tailwind.config.ts` file includes the following `content` rules to
ensure the necessary TailwindCSS utilities aren't pruned.

```typescript
import { type Config } from 'tailwindcss'
import typographyPlugin from 'npm:@tailwindcss/typography'

export default {
  plugins: [typographyPlugin],
  content: [
    '{routes,islands,components}/**/*.{ts,tsx}',

    // For Fresh Blog Plugin
    'node_modules/.deno/fresh_blog_plugin/components/**/*.tsx',
    'node_modules/.deno/fresh_blog_plugin/routes/**/*.tsx',
    'posts/*.md', // this must match `options.contentDir`
  ],
} satisfies Config
```

**Note**: It's advisable to align the last rule with `options.contentDir` to
enable the use of TailwindCSS utilities within your markdown files.

### Additional Styling

To apply CSS rules specific to code syntax highlighting and various MyST
features, include `/freshblog.css` in your layout files:

```html
<!-- Add to your routes/_app.tsx -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/freshblog.css" />
```

The `/freshblog.css` file is served during development and automatically
exported to your static files at build time. You can inspect its content in
[`./styles.css`](https://github.com/nrako/fresh_blog_plugin/blob/main/styles.css).

## Example

Explore the
[`/example`](https://github.com/nrako/fresh_blog_plugin/tree/main/example)
directory to understand how `blogPlugin()` can be implemented. The example
demonstrates that a Fresh website can host multiple blogs.

You can also run the example with `deno task example`.
